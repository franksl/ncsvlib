Schema:
- field: add possibility to override quotes char, etc. that
         are now defined in the <options> section

- Xml reader: add tests for missing arguments (es. repeat) and various checks:
  - repeat must be >= 0
  - fields inside a single record must have unique names

- Support multiline strings (see articles on the web for the correct format)

SchemaRecordBase:
- add checking methods for unique id (to be executed in Id property setter)
  (should already be implemented because it inherits from IDictionary)

DataSourceReader:
- add methods or events to recognize when a reader for a record with repeat=0 
  should stop (Read() returns false) (ie. because it's contained in a recordgroup)
  - pass parameters to open()? (ex. to put them in a WHERE clause)
  - expose events (passing current and previous lines)?

- Add generic OutputWriter that writes to a Stream (evaluate if CsvOutputWriterFile
  can be adapted or be a subclass of a new CsvOutputWriterStream class)


CsvReader:
- Add options to handle csv read errors in various ways: throw exception, 
  skip field, skip row, etc.
- If a record has repeat=true and repeat count is undefined there must be
  some method to identify the end of record, maybe by recognizing a sort
  of 'signature' for a line
- Schema: add options:
  - trimws: trim white space (for example for fixed length string fields)
  - match: reg.expr. pattern to be matched (also in writer)
